We're thrilled that you are interested in becoming a Mentor for CodingNomads. This document describes what mentorship means to CodingNomads, and what we look for in an ideal mentor. Please read this document carefully. If you have questions please reach out to Ryan, via . Requirements to Become a CodingNomads Mentor What Mentorship Means To Us What We Don't Do What We Look For In A Mentor What Mentorship Means To Us \u00b6 At CodingNomads, mentorship means that we care for our students as the individual person they are, and that we try our best to help students have an enjoyable, productive and meaningful learning process. Think of yourself as a knowledgeable learning buddy to your student. Your mentee should feel comfortable contacting you when they need you. As a great mentor, you know the course material well and you know how to efficiently find solutions which you don't yet have. One important lesson is to help your students to learn how to figure challenges out by themselves. That means that you will already know the answer, but you don't tell the solution to your student directly. Instead, when and where possible, you guide them on the path of figuring it out themselves. As a mentor, you know that it's ultimately the student's effort that makes the difference whether they will learn a lot or only a little. However, you also know that there is so much you can do to make it easier for your mentees to sit down and take that necessary effort. Check in with your students frequently, make them understand that you care for their learning process and that you are available to help. Be polite, positive, fun, and encouraging - and help your students with creating learning plans and sticking to them. Get to know your students, be compassionate, and try your best to improve the learning process for each individual student that you are working with. In a nutshell, mentorship at CodingNomads is all about caring . When a student knows that they have a mentor who cares about their learning and their progress, it's a game changer. At CodingNomads, we want our mentors to be game changers. Mentor Tips What We Don't Do \u00b6 We never make our students feel insecure about not knowing something. We don't assume that a student \"should\" know something already. If they don't know something, we patiently explain. We don't discriminate against anyone for any reason. We're all humans here, let's be nice to each other. What We Look For In A Mentor \u00b6 We want to work with mentors who know their topics well and enjoy helping others learn . If you want to mentor e.g. for our Python course, you should know Python well. If you want to mentor for Java, you should know Java. The course that you are mentoring for should be a rich learning experience for your student, which requires a certain level of expertise and fluidity with the technology. That said, we care a lot about professional development and want to give you opportunities to grow as well. We want to work with mentors who are interested in learning and education, who want to improve their own capacities as programmers and educators. Because of this, mentors who have worked with us for more than 1 year will have the opportunity to take any of our online courses free of charge. Pro-bono mentors - who are volunteering their time as a part of our pro-bono courses for underserved communities or students unemployed due to COVID-19 - will have free access to our online course curriculum after working with students for more than 2 months. We want to work with mentors who are excited to give input and suggestions to us and their fellow mentors, as well as learn from our students and mentor community. We want to work with mentors who are motivated to help with improving CodingNomads' courses and mentorship service for the benefit of all our students.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"01_requirements/#requirements-to-become-a-codingnomads-mentor","text":"Welcome!

CodingNomads Mentorship Process Starting To Work With A Student First Call CORE DUTY #1: Make Your Support Felt Get To Know Your Student Answer Forum Questions Stay Up-To-Date With Your Students' Progress Code Review The Capstone Project Grade Platform Submissions CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-On-1 Calls Set A Fixed Meeting Time Help Your Students Come Prepared Know What To Talk About Recording Video Calls Submit Session Reports (currently optional) Weekly Mentor Standup Time Tracking With TopTracker Wrap Up Working With A Student Progress Notifications The Final Call Troubleshooting Mentor Support And Questions Starting To Work With A Student \u00b6 After you've become a part of our mentor community, we will want to connect you with students. This happens as follows: Availability : We reach out to you to see if you're available to take on a new student. Student Info : Once you accept, we'll send you the student's background info. First Contact : We send a shared email to both you and your student, to establish the initial contact. First Call : You reach out to your student to schedule your first call, which is a full-time mentor call. Please send a calendar invite to the student and calendar@codingnomads.co, and the contact method you'll use to get in touch. Calendly is a useful tool to help you find a common time slot. Recurring Weekly Call : During your first call, you will schedule your standing weekly 1-on-1 call with your student. Note: We use Zoom to record all meetings for the student and our records. Here's info on Using Zoom for scheduling, video sessions, and recordings . First Call \u00b6 Preparation : Before your first call, ask the students to make as much progress on the beginning sections of the course (machine setup etc.) as possible. This will make your first meeting more productive - a great way for the student to kick off! Introduction : Since this will be the first time that you and your student meet face-to-face, take 10-15 minutes to get to know them and discuss their goals and expectations for the course. Setting clear expectations as well as clearly knowing why the student is taking the course is helpful for themselves, as well as for you, in order to better keep them accountable. Screen-Sharing : Next dive right into letting them share their screen. Make sure they\u2019ve got everything installed correctly, IDE downloaded, labs open in the IDE and able to run applications and push their work to GitHub. Help them fix what might still be missing. If there is extra time, go further into using Git or getting cozy working with their IDE. Student Support Checklist CORE DUTY #1: Make Your Support Felt \u00b6 Our students need to know that you are with them and care about their progress : Reach out to them regularly to ask how things are going Stay up-to-date with their progress using their Outline Report Share an interesting link with them We want each of our mentors to make every student feel truly supported . If possible, think of your students more as friends rather than sticking to a stiff, formal student-teacher relationship. Like good friends, we want students to feel that we are here for them when they need us. Laughter and friendship go a long way in making sure the learning process is fun! Get To Know Your Student \u00b6 Use your first call to ask them about themselves. Tell them a little bit about yourself as well. Getting to know each other and exchanging personal thoughts is often nicer on a video call than in writing. We will also provide a log file with info and notes about your student. Please add a brief, ~1-2 sentence, entry to the log after every call. It helps to keep track of their progress, motivations, and concerns. The log file is a good place to document the student's goals from week-to-week. It is also helpful to work with your student to develop a rough timeline for completing their coursework. Ask them how many hours per week they are able to dedicate to the course and help them set expectations for themselves (while remaining flexible). The optimistic \"pushing hard\" timeline for most courses is to work an average of 15 hours per week and finish in 12 weeks. You can check with the course creator or experienced mentors for insight on how long it takes students to finish particular modules, or the course in general. Answer Forum Questions \u00b6 Prompt your students to post to, answer, and discuss on the CodingNomads Forum . We want to promote the forum as a helpful and welcoming place where students and mentors interact and share knowledge. Therefore we welcome you to: Check the Forum regularly Prompt your students to discuss questions on the forum Answer your students' questions Answer other students' questions Contribute interesting posts The more information you and your students share in the public forum, the more benefit will come to the rest of our community. Stay Up-To-Date With Your Students' Progress \u00b6 Knowing where your students are currently at, what they have succeeded to do and with what they might be struggling is important so they can feel that we care about their learning process. Our platform offers ways to stay up-to-date with your students' progress. Here are instructions on how to find your students' progress logs. Please bookmark these pages for quick access: How to find your student's progress log Before your call, make sure to check where your student is at. This will also help you find topics to discuss if your student doesn't have any specific questions. Code Review The Capstone Project \u00b6 Most mentored courses include at least one larger project, called the capstone project. This project makes your students put the content they are learning into practice. Your responsibility as their mentor is to support them through their work on the capstone project: Push them to keep working on it and get it done. Answer question they have, and help them with finding solutions. Code review their project code thoroughly. We suggest you to do your code reviews on GitHub , as this will additionally prepare your students for the real-world experience of receiving code reviews directly in their code on GitHub, as well as to help them practice the process associated with that. This will be the largest project your students have worked on so far, so be patient and supportive and help them to get it done. There's nothing quite as useful and motivating as having a completed project that you built by yourself :). Grade Platform Submissions \u00b6 Our platform includes some auto-graded submissions (quizzes) and other types of submissions that are meant to be manually graded (assignments). We are planning to include some form of grading into the mentor's responsibilities since it's motivating for students to see written feedback and encouragement regarding their submissions when done by a thoughtful and supportive mentor. However, the way these manual submissions are currently set up is only as check-in points for students. Therefore, you do not currently need to grade student submissions. Please make sure to give your students feedback if they ask about any of their submissions, and pro-actively check in with them on whether they want to discuss any of the code they submitted. CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-On-1 Calls \u00b6 Alongside with making sure your students feel supported and taken care of during their learning process, the weekly 1-on-1 calls are what constitute your core mentorship offering. We recommend scheduling these calls for 1 hour. We encourage you, if possible, not to schedule meetings back-to-back so that a meeting can run long if needed. You\u2019re also encouraged to hop on extra calls with your students if your schedule permits and you feel like text is insufficient for answering a particular question, or that that would be the best way to get your student unstuck! Using Zoom for scheduling, video sessions, and recordings Set A Fixed Meeting Time \u00b6 Schedule the 1-on-1 with your student at a fixed recurring time every week . Send a recurring calendar invite for your weekly meetings so it's on both your calendars. Use your first call to lock in a time slot, then stick to it. No one enjoys the back-and-forth of trying to figure out a time, and we're aware that you have more important (and more fun) things to do with your time. Help Your Students Come Prepared \u00b6 Calls will be more productive if both you and your student come prepared. To make that more likely, you can: send an email or chat message to your student one day before your call or copy this 1:1 prep form template and send it to your student NOTE: In order to receive your students' answers when using the 1:1 prep form, you will need to \"Make a copy\" and host it on your own Google Drive. The answers are sent to the account that hosts the form. Know What To Talk About \u00b6 During your 1-on-1 call, you review their labs together and discuss their code . These labs are the content of their aforementioned submissions. \u201cGrading\u201d these submissions, therefore, happens in a live discussion with the student, rather than separate from the call. This allows students to ask specific questions and brings about a more organic discussion regarding their code. See more in Labs & Projects You will discuss challenging concepts from the course materials if the student has not quite gotten a grip on them yet. Interested students have interesting questions! Help them find the answers. You are there to help them get unstuck, and help them learn how to get unstuck by themselves (i.e., helping them to learn how to google the right questions!). Finally, you will help them create study schedules , set realistic expectations , and check in with them on their progress. You are there to hold them accountable for their plans. Help them set generous plans for themselves so that they will be able to stick to their plans. In short, during your 1-on-1 session you should : Review labs and project code together Discuss course-related concepts Answer student questions Help them schedule and stick to their plans Recording Video Calls \u00b6 Encourage students to screen-record your 1-on-1 calls . Having their mentor session recorded is useful for the students because then they can refer back to the video afterward. Students can thereby re-watch helpful parts of a meeting. Some students will be more relaxed during the call since they know they can always come back and check if they think they missed something. Submit Session Reports (currently optional) \u00b6 At the end of each session, we ask you to add a brief entry into the students log file. We want to keep it short so it doesn't take much of your time. However, consistently keeping short recaps is helpful to monitor student progress and anticipate challenges. Weekly Mentor Standup \u00b6 Every Friday, we ask you to complete a quick form. In this form you'll check in about this week's mentorship. You can raise concerns regarding a student's progress, so we can help and intervene quickly, if necessary. Please make sure to submit this form every week : Weekly Mentor Standup Time Tracking With TopTracker \u00b6 To keep track of the time you spend on mentoring your students, please use the TopTracker time tracker. TopTracker is easy to use and makes time tracking (nearly) effortless. We will use your TopTracker-recorded time to calculate your payment each month. How to use TopTracker for CodingNomads time tracking Wrap Up Working With A Student \u00b6 When you student progresses well through the course, they will eventually reach the end and graduate. At this time, please fill out the student close-out form. Please also fill out the form in the unfortunate event that the student drops out. Progress Notifications \u00b6 So that the management team can stay up-to-date with our students' progress, we ask you to send us a couple of progress updates throughout each student's course journey: 50% Complete : Send a chat message or email to Jared and Michael when your students is about halfway through the course. This is not an exact marker point, but an approximation. Capstone Started : Inform us when your student has started working on their capstone project (chat message or email) Capstone Reviewed : Once your student has finished their capstone project and you have reviewed and approved their code on GitHub, send us the final progress notification per chat message or email. This message should reach us before your final call with the student. Receiving this information from you is extremely important, so that we can commence the close-out process for that student. The Final Call \u00b6 After reviewing your student's capstone project code and letting us know that they have completed the course, you'll go on a final close-out call with your student. Similar to your intro call, this call will be a little different than your other 1:1s. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind: It's The End : Clearly state to your student that the upcoming call will be your final call. This gives them a chance to revisit topics and assemble some questions that might still linger on their minds. Request Certificate : Each course includes a Google form at the end that students can submit to request their completion certificate. Encourage them to fill this form if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Give Pointers : By the time your final call comes around, you will know your student's interests well, so you're encouraged to provide them with tips and suggestions on how to continue their learning journey following their interests. Ask For Satisfaction : Ask your student if there is anything we can do to make them completely satisfied with our service. We want to provide great mentorship and we want our students to be happy and satisfied. If they have feedback and wishes, let them know we'll do our best and pass on their suggestions to us. Ask For Reviews : Reviews are important to help others discover and trust our mentoring services. Ask your student to leave us a review on SwitchUp and CourseReport . They can write one and copy-paste to the other service. This is extremely helpful for getting the word out and building trust for our future students. Point To Our Community : Re-iterate that alumni of our courses are very welcome to keep asking and answering questions on our Forum and our chat community. They can keep reaching out to us and other students. We would love for them to be an active part of the CodingNomads community. Please make sure to encourage your student to submit the Google form to request a certificate of completion, if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Let us know over chat or email that your student is ready to graduate! \ud83c\udf89 Troubleshooting \u00b6 Check out our FAQ page . Feel free to reach out to Michael or anyone in the management team!

It helps to keep track of their progress, motivations, and concerns. The log file is a good place to document the student's goals from week-to-week. It is also helpful to work with your student to develop a rough timeline for completing their coursework. Ask them how many hours per week they are able to dedicate to the course and help them set expectations for themselves (while remaining flexible). The optimistic \"pushing hard\" timeline for most courses is to work an average of 15 hours per week and finish in 12 weeks.

This gives them a chance to revisit topics and assemble some questions that might still linger on their minds. Request Certificate : Each course includes a Google form at the end that students can submit to request their completion certificate. Encourage them to fill this form if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Give Pointers : By the time your final call comes around, you will know your student's interests well, so you're encouraged to provide them with tips and suggestions on how to continue their learning journey following their interests. Ask For Satisfaction : Ask your student if there is anything we can do to make them completely satisfied with our service. We want to provide great mentorship and we want our students to be happy and satisfied. If they have feedback and wishes, let them know we'll do our best and pass on their suggestions to us. Ask For Reviews : Reviews are important to help others discover and trust our mentoring services. Ask your student to leave us a review on SwitchUp and CourseReport . They can write one and copy-paste to the other service. This is extremely helpful for getting the word out and building trust for our future students.

How To Be A Great Mentor Know Your Student Be Their Guide Let Them Teach Encourage Study Groups Have A Plan Encourage Student Peer Reviews Do Mentor Peer Reviews Do Code Reviews Check For Code Repository Updates Know Your Student \u00b6 Keeping a solid overview who each of your students are, what their aims are, and how they are progressing, is essential in knowing how to help them best. Progress: Keep track of your student's progress! Use the platform for help. Notes: Take notes after calls. You can make a copy of this pre-set doc . If you make it a habit to take notes and check up on each student's progress, you'll be in a much better position to help them in their learning process. Be Their Guide \u00b6 Explain to your students that you are here as a guide . You cannot fill knowledge into their heads, and you won't be with them all the time. However, you are there to help them navigate through the learning maze. Help them take the right turns, and make it easier for them to see the path they need to walk and assist them in taking the necessary steps. Let Them Teach \u00b6 You can explain a concept to your mentee, if they don't yet have it all figured out. Next time you see someone ask the same question e.g. on the Forum, try to give your first mentee a chance to explain it to the next person ! Send them a link, remind them that you went over this together, and ask them to answer the question for the other student. Explaining a concept to someone else is a very effective learning tool. Encourage Study Groups \u00b6 Study groups are awesome! They bring great results for learners. However, it is hard to make productive study groups work well remotely. Therefore, most of the time your mentee will learn by themselves. If you see an opportunity to make their learning more social, e.g. by connecting them with one of your other mentees when they are working on a similar challenge, do it! Please feel free to facilitate and encourage such connections between students . Have A Plan \u00b6 It's easy to procrastinate if you don't have a plan. One of your tasks is to make it as easy as possible for your mentees to have a clear and actionable plan that is scheduled on their own calendar. Students need to: Know what they are expected to do very clearly Have a time plan on when they will work on it Understand when they'll want to have it done Have accountability for their plans and their workload As a mentor, you can be a great help with helping them to set up a study plan, make sure that it is realistic so they won't get frustrated by constantly not meeting their aims, have your students assign time slots on their calendars, and finally also provide accountability by checking back with them to see whether they are sticking to the plan. Explain to them that they can split themselves into two personalities for getting things done: The benevolent planner The diligent executioner During planning, you need to keep your own best interests in mind. How much time can I really set aside for this, and when? How much can I really get done during a time slot? Suggest them to set their time slots and goals according to a benevolent plan that they create for themselves. This is important for the second phase, execution. If you set yourself up for a productive and motivating time during your planning session, then it'll be much easier to sit down as planned and simply execute. Not having to worry about whether the thing you're doing right now is the best use of your time makes for much more productive work sessions. Encourage Student Peer Reviews \u00b6 Learning through teaching is a thing, and we want our students to learn as effectively as possible. If you can, and if they agree to it, give your students a chance to look at each other's work and do peer reviews of each other's code. This is a great learning opportunity for both of your students. Your role is to make sure they do the peer reviews in a respectful, correct, and productive way. Do Mentor Peer Reviews \u00b6 Show your work to other mentors. Allow them to learn from you and learn from them and their feedback. Small circles of people that have a strong interest in something and stick together to openly, constructively, criticize each other, that's how specialized groups of people develop. It would be awesome if we together developed ourselves as an elite group of awesome programing mentors that are close to each other, highly skilled, and super effective in teaching students to code. Do Code Reviews \u00b6 We're currently using GitHub in-line comments for code review. This gets students more familiar with additional functionality in GitHub and makes it easy for us to provide well-formatted and on-the-spot feedback. If you are not familiar with giving code reviews in GitHub, check out our Guide on giving GitHub Reviews . Difficulties : There are some downsides to this process. E.g. it's difficult to code review for students who commit code often because a piece of code you are providing feedback on might not be the most recent version. What helps with this is to always start at doing your code review on the latest commit. Logical Commits : Generally, advise your students to commit logical pieces of work, e.g. when they finished one lab, or when they finished the labs for one full section of the course. This is a good practice for software development anyways, and helps them get used to working in that way early on. Pull Requests : If your students are more experienced working with GitHub, you can also suggest them to create Pull Requests. PRs squash multiple commits and you can do a proper code review on the changes introduced through the PR, which is optimal for everyone's convenience, as well as closest to real-life software development and code review processes. Check For Code Repository Updates \u00b6 Students should have easy access to code examples and exercises. We host our code on GitHub. Labs and example code are provided in a well-structured repository that students can download and push to their own GitHub. Students should also set up a second remote that is pointing to the original repo . We will keep the original repo up-to-date, e.g. with feedback received from you and your students. Students can then pull updates from that second remote.

You can skip that section while setting up your TopTracker account. Track Mentorship Time \u00b6 Once you've started working with a student, we will set up a Project with your student's name and invite you as a Freelancer . From then on, you'll track the time you spend mentoring this student in their dedicated project. If you are working with multiple students, make sure to record your time for each student in the correct project. To minimize your effort, when logging time to a student project, you can limit your tracking entries to the following keywords: call forum slack code review organization Watch the screencast below, which shows you how mentorship time tracking with TopTracker works in practice: Please follow this workflow to keep track of the time you spend working with your student.

Mentor_Admin and Community Support Projects \u00b6 We will also invite you to two projects called mentor_admin and Community Support . Mentor_admin can be used for miscellaneous administrative activities such as internal meetings (e.g., Python Mentors Meeting ). Community Support can be used to answer questions on the forum or the general slack channels (i.e., helping students for which you don\u2019t have a specific project). When charging to these two projects, please put both a keyword (from the list above) and a specific description in the TopTracker activity description. For example: \u201cSlack: supporting Tiffany, connecting to databases, general JDBC\u201d or \u201cForum: responded to this question: https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/lab-9-data-wrangle-a-dataset/1244\u201d.

Please submit all invoices each month in order to get paid. Scheduling With Google Calendar \u00b6 You'll use Google Calendar for scheduling your student calls. If you don't have a Google account, please sign up for one . Always invite \"calendar@codingnomads.co\" to all meetings Also Please include the student's name in the meeting title . For example \"Ryan and Michael\". This helps us to keep track of the student's meetings. Booking Meetings With Calendly \u00b6 To make life easier for you, you can use Calendly .

Using their free tier, you can specify the times you are available for meetings, then send your student a link where they can choose a time that works for them. Calendly can significantly reduce the effort needed to find a time that works for both you and your students. It also integrates with Google Calendar. Recording Meetings On Google Calendar \u00b6 Every student meeting you have needs to be recorded on our CN Scheduling Calendar at calendar@codingnomads.co . We use this information to keep track of how far along students are in their subscription.

Make sure to update the calendar by moving or deleting the meeting. We can only guarantee payment for meetings that show up on this calendar. You will also be invited to a calendar invite that represents the student's last week at CodingNomads. If you and your student decide not to meet one week, please update the calendar to add a week to the student's program. For example, if your student requests a week off for christmas (encouraged!), and their last date is January 1st, then update the calendar to show that their last date is now January 8th. If there is any confusion on this topic, please ask Jared or Michael. Video Sessions and Recordings With Zoom \u00b6 We use Zoom for 1-on-1 calls, because it allows screen sharing and screen recording.

Please review the information below that corresponds with your tax status. Payment & Tax Information US Citizens/Residents If you have Zelle If you don\u2019t have Zelle Non US Citizens/Residents Monthly Payment Process Payment Support Please submit your 1) IRS form and 2) Direct Deposit Authorization Form to . For added security, please share these docs in a Google Drive Folder, or send via a secure file sharing system like Dropbox. US Citizens/Residents \u00b6 If you are a US citizen or resident, have a US social security number / ITIN, and/or you file a tax return in the United States, please complete, sign, and send to CodingNomads: IRS form W-9 for independent contractors. Next year by January 31, if you billed more than $600 in the previous year, we will provide you with form 1099-NEC to file on your US taxes. Please be aware that in general, after your first year of contracting, the IRS expects you to submit quarterly estimated tax payments. If you do not pay estimated taxes, the IRS may charge penalties when you file your annual return. Not to be a buzzkill...but in case you didn't know! Chat with your accountant or Kim if you have questions about that. Direct Deposit Authorization Form using the following instructions: If you have Zelle \u00b6 For US contractors we typically pay by Zelle ACH transfers, which are free of charge. Zelle partners with most major US banks, and must be linked to your checking account (not your debit card). If you have a Zelle email address / phone number, please include it in the Direct Deposit Form. Zelle members do not need to provide your personal banking information in the Form. If you don\u2019t have Zelle \u00b6 If you do not have Zelle, we pay by Wise ACH bank transfers, which charge the recipient a <1% fee. Please fill out all of your information in the Direct Deposit Form to receive ACH transfers. Non US Citizens/Residents \u00b6 If you are not a US Citizen or resident, and you do NOT file a tax return in the US, please complete, sign, and send to CodingNomads: IRS form W-8 BEN . This form states that you: are not a US citizen or resident, do not have a US SSN / ITIN, do not pay US taxes, and you do pay taxes in your home country, and therefore you are not subject to having money withheld in the US because your country has a tax treaty with the US to avoid double taxation. Generally you can find your US tax treaty information online, or consult your tax professional if you have questions. This form does not get submitted to the IRS, rather it's a form CodingNomads keeps on file in the case that we get audited to explain why we do not withhold 30% of your paycheck for US taxes. IRS form W-8 BEN . This form states that you are not subject to having money withheld from your paychecks for US taxes, because you meet ALL of the following: are not a US citizen nor resident, do not have a US SSN / ITIN, do pay taxes in your home country, and have a tax treaty with the US (most countries do). Generally you can find your US tax treaty information online, or consult your tax professional. This form does not get submitted to the IRS, rather we must keep it on file in the case of an audit. Direct Deposit Authorization Form . For international contractors, we pay by Wise ACH bank transfers. Wise charges the lowest recipient fee (~1%) and offers the best exchange rates of any other service we've found. Monthly Payment Process \u00b6 On the first day of each month, please go into your TopTracker Invoices section, then create and submit an invoice for each of your projects for the previous month: We will process invoices two times at the beginning of each month: If you submit your invoices by the 1st, you'll get paid by the 10th or sooner. If you submit by the 10th, you'll get paid by the 15th. For example, for the hours you invoiced from December, you will be paid by January 15. If you don't submit by the 10th, you won't get paid until the next month's invoicing cycle, or the month after you choose to submit your invoices. Please help us keep this process efficient by remembering to submit your invoices, so we can pay you faster! Ultimately it is up to you to submit your invoices on time to get paid on time. Please keep the following in mind: Time Tracking: Since you are keeping time in TopTracker and we have access to these time entries, you don't need to send us anything additional once we have your payment details - just the monthly invoice generated for each project.

For How Many Students Can I Mentor? \u00b6 We want to be able to invest in you and make you part of our mentor community. Therefore, we aim for a minimum of 3 students per mentor. There's currently no maximum number of students you can take on, as long as it fits in your schedule and you can provide the high quality and allotted time commitment that we expect. If you're thinking of taking on more than 10 students, please get in contact so we can better understand your situation and motivations. Who To Contact Regarding Payment? \u00b6 Write an email to . Who To Contact Regarding General Mentorship Questions? \u00b6 Write an email to or ping @Michael on slack. What if I forget turn on my tracker?! Or, even worse, forget to turn it off? \u00b6 On its web application, in the \"my activities\" tab, TopTracker allows you to manually add, edit, or delete time. My Student Wants To Reschedule A Meeting \u00b6 If a student needs to reschedule one of their meetings and does so with adequate notice (12 hours or more), we'd encourage you to find a new time with them. Life can get in the way, and as long as this is an exception, and you can manage to make time in your own schedule, we want to support students to have their mentor sessions. We hope, and expect reschedules to be rare. You have no obligation to reschedule any meeting with the student if it happens outside of the agreed-upon time slot. We understand that you have other work to do, and we want to set clear examples to avoid time spent on scheduling wherever possible. If you do want to reschedule, it is at your own discretion to do so. If rescheduling happens often , please let the student know that they should find a different time slot for your 1-on-1 call. Also, please inform Michael at . My Student Didn't Show For A Scheduled 1-On-1 Call \u00b6 Your meeting time slot should be on a fixed time every week . If a student does not show up for your meeting and doesn't contact you more than 12 hours ahead of the scheduled time, this will be considered a no-show . If you haven't heard from your student until the meeting time, please wait for 10 minutes to see whether they are just late, then cancel the call. Record the no-show in your Session Report. You may charge 50% of the scheduled call time in the event of a no-show. This also applies if the student cancels within 12 hours of a shceduled meeting. Record the 50% time in your TopTracker activities and make sure to mention it was a no-show in your Session Report. Please clearly communicate to your students that we aim for a professional environment , which means, in this case, to stick to scheduled meetings as much as possible, and give at least 24 hours notice if they need to cancel. After a no-show, please make sure to check in with the student and get confirmation that they\u2019ll attend the next meeting. Please contact Michael if: -you don\u2019t hear from the student for a week after the no-show, -if they don\u2019t show up for two weeks in a row (despite confirming their expected attendance). My Student Has Not Responded For Several Days \u00b6 Some students need a tad more encouragement than others. Please attempt to get and stay in contact with your mentee even if they seem unresponsive. Ask them if there's any way you can help (coding-related or maybe with time management tips), send encouraging words, an interesting link or a funny coding-related meme. However, if you haven't heard back from your mentee in more than a week, please reach out to . The Website Says Students Get Unlimited Support - How Much Time Should I Invest? \u00b6 This means that students are not limited to just their one weekly call. If they want, they can ask questions any time to their mentor on slack or, if they'd like a potentially quicker answer, the public chat channels. They also have access to the forum. Few students go over the 1.5, occasionally 2, hours of direct 1-on-1 mentorship per week. Most students stay below it. So if there are a few students here and there that are really soaking up your mentor time, then it's okay because they can basically absorb the mentorship time that we have allotted and budgeted for other students, but that those other students haven't used. We tell our potential students that they have one scheduled call per week, but that they are highly encouraged to reach out anytime they are stuck or have a question. We tell them that anyone of our mentors will get back to them ASAP. And this is unlimited. We used to do two calls per week but most students ended up cancelling the second call. If you feel the student has a question that would be easier to answer on a call, and you have time, feel free to offer to hop on an extra call. How Closely Should I Monitor My Students' Progress? \u00b6 Stay up-to-date with what they're working on, it'll make your 1:1 call more effective and your support more actionable for the student. Use the Outline Report provided in our platform to help with that. You can also set up an agreement with your student that they check in with you every day in a stand-up fashion and send you a quick message on: what are they currently working on? what are they stuck on, if anything? what are their plans for today? Also, ask them to share their GitHub account with you. You can subscribe to be notified when they push updates, which makes it easier for you to keep track of their progress with the labs. Being up-to-date with your students' progress helps to build an understanding of their knowledge and blind spots.

I'm excited to be working with you. I'll send along some scheduling information shortly so that we can set up our first meeting. If you'd like, we'd love for you to post an introduction about yourself on the [Introductions thread in our forum](https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/introductions/29) when you get a chance. Looking forward to meeting you :) Intro Follow-up Email \u00b6 Hi again `{STUDENT_NAME}`, I sent you a Slack message with this same info, and I want to email it too to make sure it reaches you. Let's try to keep our conversations in Slack moving forward. Slack is designed for conversation, and it's easier to keep our communication in one place. Sorry for the duplicate info if you already saw this on Slack :) I'm hoping to set up a call with you for this week so that we can get to know each other and touch base on learning methods, priorities, goals, etc., as we'll make sure that you're all set up and ready to get started. I'm currently in `{MENTOR_LOCATION}`, so my time zone is `{MENTOR_TIMEZONE}`. You're currently in `{STUDENT_LOCATION}`, right? Let me know which times work best regarding your schedule. I put the times that will work best for me for our first call in this scheduling tool linked below. Please vote on the listed time that works best for you. If you don't see a time that works for you, please write back and we'll figure something else out: `{SCHEDULING_LINK}` This meeting time is primarily for our first call, but if it works well, we can use the same time slot for our recurring meeting times moving forward, too. Looking forward to hearing from you, `{MENTOR_NAME}` CodingNomads Slack Response And Forum Prompt \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`! Great to hear from you! :) You're welcome to contact me here on slack any time, and you can also use the `{COURSE_CHANNEL}` channel for any course and content-related thoughts. You can also use any other channel here that makes sense to you! When you get the time, please write a quick intro on our forum: https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/introductions/29 The forum is a great resource for searching for, asking, discussing, and answering questions - talking about code essentially! Glad to have you on board and let me know if you need anything. First Call Follow-Up \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`, Nice to meet you today! I'll post the recording from our call shortly in the Google Photos album that I shared with you. You'll always be able to re-watch our calls there. I'll also be sending you an invite for our call for next week at the time we discussed. As you go through coursework or other programming related projects, I hope you'll find a couple of opportunities to fill out this little questionnaire. Filling this out is primarily for the practice of stepping back when encountering challenging programming tasks. What you come up with is mostly for you, but if it ends up being helpful and you'd like to go over some results during an upcoming call, please mention it and we can talk about it more. **Stepping back when a problem feels challenging at first glance** **Fill out the following 2 questions before attempting the challenge:** 1. What is the assignment or question? 2. What do you feel you don't know about it, or which parts do you predict will be challenging? **Fill out the next three questions after and during your attempt:** 3. Did you manage to figure it out? 4. Did the things you listed in question num. 2 end up being relevant to the assignment? If so, did they end up being difficult aspects of the assignment? 5. (If any) What resources did you use when working on the assignment? Please take note of ones that were helpful, and feel free to specify if any resources were particularly unhelpful... Attempt this exercise a couple of times. Copy paste it into a file, and jot down some notes to answer each question. Give this process a fair try, it could turn out to be helpful to have it as a record of your progress. On another note, here are some social accounts you can check out and follow. It's a great way to get involved into the larger programming community, and that helps with getting and staying excited about it all! :) `{COURSE_SOCIAL_LINKS}` That's it! Hope you have a nice week and again, please reach out on Slack if you have any questions. All the best, `{MENTOR_NAME}` Preparation For The Weekly Call \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`! Our weekly call is coming up, and I want to make sure that you'll take the most from the time we have together. It helps to get us both prepared and focused, if you **fill the following questionnaire** each week before our call, and **send it to me**: - I'm currently in section\u2026 - Questions I want to talk about: - I'm currently stuck with\u2026 - I've tried to solve this challenge by doing the following (links to code repo, orum posts, relevant StackOverflow resources etc. are very welcome!): - When will I code during the upcoming week? - Something interesting or cool I've learned or discovered: - Other topics I want to talk about: Thanks, And looking forward to talking soon! `{MENTOR_NAME}` Prompt To Stick With Weekly Meetings \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`! Hope it's been going well for you. You mentioned you'd like to cancel this week's call. I just wanted to suggest you to try to be as consistent as possible with the calls. It really helps to think of it as a weekly institution - even if you haven\u2019t made too much progress. We can always talk over some older piece of code, or ask me to give you some quick thoughts or preview the material together. Sticking to that routine, that you know you\u2019ll have your call every week, helps with staying on track. It really does! : ) That\u2019s why it helps to find a good time that\u2019ll very likely work for you every week - and then we just keep at it! Hope that makes sense, let me know if you have any questions. I'm just trying to make it the most effective for you - and we\u2019ve learned that the regular calls really do help. :) Twitter Accounts To Suggest \u00b6 One of your tasks as a mentor is to get your students involved in the programming community. If your students use Twitter, you can suggest them to follow some relevant programming accounts: @TalkPython @realpython @PyData @ProjectJupyter @PythonChat @PythonInsider @pybites @mkennedy @fullstackpython @laurenleemack @erinroseglass @pati_gallardo @sailorhg @samantha_gold @marie dm @b0rk @lisaironcutter @moyheen @shannonkao @tiny_mssn_ctrl @computerfact @AndreyAzimov @IFashionModels @iamdevloper @o_guest @lukew @q_dork @ChicagoPython @SaraJChipps @bethahdc3 @weLearnWeCode @gdichicago @chihacknight @lisajdesignsgib","title":"Templates"},{"location":"12_templates/#student-communication-templates","text":"You can set these up as Gmail templates or copy-paste the text from here.

I'll post the recording from our call shortly in the Google Photos album that I shared with you. You'll always be able to re-watch our calls there. I'll also be sending you an invite for our call for next week at the time we discussed. As you go through coursework or other programming related projects, I hope you'll find a couple of opportunities to fill out this little questionnaire. Filling this out is primarily for the practice of stepping back when encountering challenging programming tasks. What you come up with is mostly for you, but if it ends up being helpful and you'd like to go over some results during an upcoming call, please mention it and we can talk about it more. **Stepping back when a problem feels challenging at first glance** **Fill out the following 2 questions before attempting the challenge:** 1. What is the assignment or question? 2. What do you feel you don't know about it, or which parts do you predict will be challenging? **Fill out the next three questions after and during your attempt:** 3. Did you manage to figure it out? 4. Did the things you listed in question num. 2 end up being relevant to the assignment? If so, did they end up being difficult aspects of the assignment? 5. (If any) What resources did you use when working on the assignment? Please take note of ones that were helpful, and feel free to specify if any resources were particularly unhelpful... Attempt this exercise a couple of times. Copy paste it into a file, and jot down some notes to answer each question. Give this process a fair try, it could turn out to be helpful to have it as a record of your progress. On another note, here are some social accounts you can check out and follow. It's a great way to get involved into the larger programming community, and that helps with getting and staying excited about it all! :) `{COURSE_SOCIAL_LINKS}` That's it! Hope you have a nice week and again, please reach out on Slack if you have any questions.

Our weekly call is coming up, and I want to make sure that you'll take the most from the time we have together.

Hope it's been going well for you. You mentioned you'd like to cancel this week's call. I just wanted to suggest you to try to be as consistent as possible with the calls. It really helps to think of it as a weekly institution - even if you haven\u2019t made too much progress. We can always talk over some older piece of code, or ask me to give you some quick thoughts or preview the material together. Sticking to that routine, that you know you\u2019ll have your call every week, helps with staying on track. It really does! : ) That\u2019s why it helps to find a good time that\u2019ll very likely work for you every week - and then we just keep at it! Hope that makes sense, let me know if you have any questions. I'm just trying to make it the most effective for you - and we\u2019ve learned that the regular calls really do help. :)","title":"Prompt To Stick With Weekly Meetings"},{"location":"12_templates/#twitter-accounts-to-suggest","text":"One of your tasks as a mentor is to get your students involved in the programming community.

They are using Linux, so they've stumbled into a couple of issues. We installed Slack and Zoom together, as well as git, and cloned the repo so they can begin to work on the labs. They haven't had much time because of a big project at work but said it's done now and as of tomorrow will have more time to focus fully on the course. They are self-taught with SQL and worked as a data analyst before. It's clear that they know how to google and are motivated to work through stuff. They were a bit worried there'd be too much reading for their taste, but I explained about the labs and projects and that I'm happy to provide more project ideas and links to make it even more practical. That seemed to resound well with them. ### 2019-05-09 They skimmed over the exercises and completed some that they didn't know so well yet (File I/O etc.). I introduced code reviews, both that I can do them if they submit links, as well as that I'll want students to do it for each other on the Forum, if possible. They are originally from Veenendaal, which is fun for me because I spent two weeks there working with a friend on a startup idea. They've been working on a Django project before (a course platform, essentially) and they'll keep doing that while brushing up on the topics covered in our course. I introduced that it's very useful that they know something already, and that they'll be able to learn a lot through teaching others on the Forum. They're looking forward to the interactions and discussions. I think it will be helpful to direct them to use the Forums as often as possible since they could provide good contributions AND seem to learn very well through discussing and explaining topics.

Feel free to add your own. Structure Your 1-On-1 Sessions \u00b6 Here are some suggestions that can make it easier to set yourself and your student up for a productive 1:1 call. Send them a reminder and some prep questions 1 day before your scheduled call Say hi on chat frequently, and be friendly and motivating Ask whether they have any specific struggles or questions Ask them to walk you through everything they did since your last call For more tips, you can read the section on how to Know What To Talk About . Push For Regular Meetings \u00b6 It is important to meet with your student, even if nothing went forward on their end. It\u2019s first and foremost the human contact that creates and upkeeps motivation. Encourage your students to meet regularly! You can use a template to prompt to stick with weekly meetings . Find a time that works for them, and stick to it. Social accountability is motivating for humans! Teach And Learn Through Code Reviews \u00b6 GitHub allows you to create in-line code comments in commits. Giving and getting code reviews is a great way to improve your coding skills. It trains you to: read and understand other people's code learn about different solutions to a task formulate your thoughts in relation to code give constructive feedback , and learn from receiving it Below, you'll find more information about how we suggest to do code reviews on GitHub, and what to focus on. Code Review Guidelines \u00b6 Be Nice : When you give a code review to a student, be nice! No one benefits from a nasty review. Give Directions : As with mentorship in general, avoid giving solutions directly. Find the solution yourself, then give the other person hints so they can figure it out on their own. We learn the most by figuring something out ourselves. Use Markdown : Readability helps. Use Markdown to make your comment nicely formatted. And you can use emojis, too. Types Of Code Review Comments \u00b6 Suggestions : Suggest improvements if you find something that's incorrect or could be improved. Congratulations : Give positive feedback if there's something you liked or found interesting. Challenges : Introduce challenges if you see that someone is onto something and might benefit from a nudge into a specific direction. Examples [TODO] \u00b6 Here are some examples of code reviews from the on-site course part. Read over them to get an idea of how to give code reviews. Do Code Reviews On GitHub \u00b6 Every time your student commits code and pushes it to GitHub, it will be available for other people to comment on. Use the great in-line code comment functionality on GitHub commits to facilitate learning and get your students used to the idea of code reviews. Go over how to create and interact with GitHub code comments together with your student on a call. Add Code Comments On GitHub \u00b6 Here's a step-by-step walk-through for adding a comment to a GitHub commit: Go to your student's GitHub account, choose the right repository and navigate to their commits: You will see a page similar to the following screenshot. Once there, click on a single commit (you can do this for every commit!). This steps you into the code that was added/changed/deleted during that specific commit: Inside of a commit's page, you'll see code lines, some of them green and red. The view is split up on a per file basis and you can easily comment directly in a specific line by clicking on the blue plus that appears when hovering over a line: Clicking it opens up a comment box, like so: Type your code comment into this box. Remember our code review tips , e.g. that Markdown is supported. You can check up on your result by clicking the Preview tab: Finally, click Add single comment and your feedback is live!

Mentorship Tips \u00b6 Read our quick mentorship tips here . Having Trouble With A Student/Mentee? \u00b6 Please inform Ryan ( ) and Martin ( ) as quickly as possible and we'll help get everything sorted. Establishing Contact With Students \u00b6 Reach out to your mentee over email, introduce yourself, and start scheduling your first 1-on-1 call. Use Zoom : If possible, please use Zoom for these calls. That way, you and/or your student can record the call. Recording the calls can be very useful for your student so they can refer back to all the amazing wisdom you share during the call. It's easy to skip the recording part, but we've learned over time that the students are always grateful to have the ability to refer back to parts of the conversation/demo/etc after it took place. The Introductory Zoom Meeting \u00b6 Have Fun : Try not to worry. Keep it casual and comfortable for yourself and your mentee. Get To Know Your Student : Spend a little time chatting. Ask them questions about what their goals are, what they're hoping to do/learn, what kind of job/gig they'd love to be able to land, etc. Share Your Experience : Give them time to ask you any questions they might have about your job, experience, challenges, etc. Draft Your Learning Plan : Spend some time determining the most effective and relevant material you can share with them over the coming weeks. Understand Your Student's Time Commitment : Determine how much time they'll be able to study and learn on their own each week. This will inform the scope of what you share. Schedule Your Calls : Schedule your next 3 calls in advance during the first call. For instance, every Tuesday at 6pm PDT. Please create calendar invites for these sessions and invite your mentee. All Normal Mentor Sessions \u00b6 Plan : Come with a plan of what you'd like to share, present, demonstrate for ~30 minutes. Show : Share your screen and demonstrate the skills you're sharing Share docs, Github repos, links, screenshots, etc with them to keep them engaged with the material after your call(s) Discuss : Leave ~30 minutes time available to discuss these concepts with your mentee Summarize : At the end of each call, please try to summarize the new concepts you've discussed and put them in context In Between Mentor Sessions (Optional Bonus) \u00b6 Quick Check-Ins : It can be really great to reach out to our mentees in between scheduled calls. While it doesn't take long to send them a quick email asking if they've made progress, if they've completed that tutorial, if they've read this article, etc., it can be a big help to keep them engaged. Final Mentor Session \u00b6 Work Started : Do your best to make sure they have projects started, GitHub repos created and plenty of opportunity for forward progress. Next Steps : Send them off with a collection of tasks, next steps for them to work on. Contact Opportunity : If all has gone well and you feel comfortable with that, let them know they can reach out to you in the future. Continue Helping : Are you interested in continuing to work with them? If so, please feel free to continue at your own schedule. What If My Mentee Doesn't Return Emails/Calls? \u00b6 Please inform Ryan ( ) and Martin ( ) if you're having any trouble connecting with your student/mentee. Can I Stop Working With My Student/Mentee? \u00b6 Yes. You can stop working with your student at any time. Your participation is completely voluntary.
